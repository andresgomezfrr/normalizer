The normalizer has some internal topics that are used to save and recover the configuration and to do some computations.

`__normalizer_bootstrap`: This topic is used by [Kafka Bootstraper](https://wizzie.io/normalizer/bootstrapper/kafka-boostrapper.html).
`__$APPID_normalizer_$STREAM1_to_$STREAM2`: when the normalizer needs to do a repartition using different key, it creates a new topic using this format. The $APPID is the application id used on the config file, the $STREAM1 is the name of the current stream and the $STREAM2 is the name of the new partitioned stream.
