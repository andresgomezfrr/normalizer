# Normalizer

Normalizer is a stream processing engine based of Kafka Streams. Normalizer does maps (staless and stafull), flatmaps and filters by us. You only need to define a JSON stream where you specify the process logic and how the message are transformed.

Normalizer offers us: scalability, fault tolerance, back-preassure, KV states (RocksDB) and full Kafka integration ... [Try it now!!](http://wizzie.io/normalizer/getting/getting-started.html)
