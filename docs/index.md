Normalizer is a stream processing engine based of Kafka Streams. Normalizer does maps (stateless and stateful), flatmaps and filters by us. You only need to define a JSON stream where you specify the process logic and how the messages are transformed.

Normalizer is the one of the components of Wizzie Workflow used by:

* **[Wizzie Data Platform: WDP](https://wizzie.io/what-is-wizzie/#platform)**
* **[Wizzie Community Stack: WCS](https://github.com/wizzie-io/community-stack)**
